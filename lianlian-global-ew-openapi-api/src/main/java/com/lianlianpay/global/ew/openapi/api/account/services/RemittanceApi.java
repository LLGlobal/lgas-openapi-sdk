/**
 * <h3>Remittance</h3>
 * This service is designed to be a secure and convenient way
 * for sending CNY to individuals in mainland China.
 * Overseas remitters can easily make cross-border remittances
 * to UnionPay cards of 70 national and local banks,
 * including industrial and Commercial Bank of China, Bank of China, China Construction Bank, Agricultural Bank of China, Bank of communications, Huaxia Bank and Bank of Dalian.
 * Cardholders in China can directly collect the money in RMB to further consume or withdraw to avoid the trouble of foreign exchange.
 * The payee does not need to handle the payment of remittance or pay the bank service fee;
 * she/he can use the money directly. In general, the remittance is deposited into the payeeâ€™s account in real time or within 12 hours.
 * According to China's State Administration of Foreign Exchange (SAFE), each person can receive a maximum of $50,000 per year and settle the exchange in yuan.
